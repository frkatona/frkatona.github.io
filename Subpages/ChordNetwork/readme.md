# TODO

- [x] get chord names to appear as text

- [x] fine tune the force and size so everything is readable and things don't move so far away from each other

- [ ] fancy on-click events

  - [ ] playing the chord (requires reworking the json structure and by extension the json maker script)

  - [ ] bloom that moves along the line to show the various connections and maybe flash their node ids at the top for a moment

- [ ] add connection colors and a legend for them and arrows

- [ ] add an option to change from relative to a given key

- [ ] dark mode

- [ ] distinct click and drag spot for changing the force center

- [ ] polish script that converts the json

- [ ] "create"/"randomize" functionality

  - [ ] create 'x' bars chord progression randomize button with fancy blooms and then plays the progression

  - [ ] allow user to reroll any of the chords in the new progression without affecting the others
