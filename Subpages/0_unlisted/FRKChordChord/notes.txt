 - chord progression constructor that suggests the next chord based on previous chord
 - idea 1: start with random starter chord progression and update randomization based on sliders

predictive changes
 - chord number
 - sus2/4, 6, extensions, etc
 - voicing -> (open/closed, voice leading)
 - mode mixture

predictive factors:
 - position
 - voice leading

calculate
 - voicing
   - openness (average distance between adjacent notes)
   - mud (distance between two lowest notes)
   - leading (distance between lowest note and previous lowest note; chromatic walk between neighbors)
   - melody (distance between highest note and previous highest note)

user input
 - checkbox: borrowed Chords
 - [gravity collier thing]
 - set up key change
   - brightness/darkness CoF direction
 - movement vs vamp

Base Progressions:
I - V - vi - IV
ii - V - I - VI
I - vi - ii - V
