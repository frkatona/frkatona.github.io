 - visual blocks appear to auto-complete progression
 - shows list of songs that use the chord progression or are close to it
   - would need some kind of dictionary of songs with chord progressions

later
 - play a sine wave simulation of chord progression w/ volume/bpm sliders
 - creative sliders (voicing/leading, extensions, mode mixture, etc.)
 - would 3/4 be hard?
