It's Not Alright
(F#, 120 bpm)


Intro:
| [F#]- - [A]- - | | [E]- - [D]- - | (x2)


Verse1:
[F#] There's a [A]hollow where the [E]cold wind bl[D]ows
Where the [F#]whir of ma[A]chinery and the [E]mocking bird [D]slurs
A [F#]town where the [A]people walk [E]to and [D]fro
At the [F#]center of the [A]Earth beneath the [E]lightning [D]glow


Chorus:
[G] It's not al[D]right, it's not al[A]right  [A]
[G] It's not al[D]right, it's not al[A]right  [A]
[G] Have we [D]built on this here [A]life  [A]
[G] Hang up your [D]friends, teach them to [B]fight  [B]


| - - - - | | - - - - | (x2)


Verse2:
[F#] It's like we're [A]moving through a [E]tv [D]show
[F#]Camera's almost [A]running and mor[E]ality is [D]low
With a [F#]globe on our [A]shoulders, the [E]pain in[D]doors
Make a [F#]lasting imp[A]ression as the [E]world expl[D]odes


Chorus:
[G] It's not al[D]right, it's not al[A]right  [A]
[G] It's not al[D]right, it's not al[A]right  [A]
[G] Have we [D]built on this here [A]life  [A]
[G] Hang up your [D]friends, teach them to [B]fight  [B]


Verse3:
[F#] Morality be[A]gins where an[E]atomy [D]ends
It's a [F#]whirlwind [A]twist on the [E]whole damn [D]pants
It's the [F#]feeling that you [A]get when you're [E]out of [D]hope
Like a [F#]tightening [A]knot at the [E]end of your [D]rope 


Chorus:
[G] It's not al[D]right, it's not al[A]right  [A]
[G] It's not al[D]right, it's not al[A]right  [A]
[G] What have we [D]built on this here [A]life  [A]
[G] Call up your [D]friends, teach them to [B]fight  [B]
