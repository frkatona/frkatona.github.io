Cover-up Song

Intro:
|[D]- - - -| (x16)

Verse1:
Whether fate is real, we don't know
Try to shape it as long as we go
So hard to notice any good in the world
The power plays off in the world


Prechorus:
Anymore
Anymore


Chorus:
This world's gone mad
Not gonna trust on the enemy
Down, I'm going down
If I don't stand my ground

In a pommel of asdf
asdf
asdf
Do you wanna know

Verse2:
Propaganda, fearing soul
Cower down behind the doors
So hard to see it come to the sun
We're hypnotized by a diabolic foe

Prechorus:
Let it go, let it go
Let it go, let it go

Chorus:
This world's gone mad
Not gonna trust on the enemy
Down, I'm going down
If I don't stand my ground

In a pommel of asdf
asdf
asdf
It was so slow

Instrumental:
| - - - - | (xlike 100)

Verse3:
I felt it shimmer, shake, and fold
Each piece of touch makes it bullshit more
Standing at the edge of a hellish glory
It's time I brought this pestilence home

Prechorus:
Destiny, at home
Destiny, at home

Chorus:
This world's gone mad
The people we trust are the enemy
Down, you're going down
If I gotta stand my ground

In a puddle of blood I'll be looking down
In a bottle of souls to down
Do you wanna...
know
