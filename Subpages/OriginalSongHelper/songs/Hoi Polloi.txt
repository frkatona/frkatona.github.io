[G]     [D9sus4]
[G]     [D9sus4]

Verse_1:
[G]   We are all a mystery until we’re known    [D9sus4]
[G]   This world can be a scary [D9sus4]place
[G]   I'm leaning hard on this micro[D9sus4]phone
[G]   Helps me catch a glimpse of your [D9sus4]face

Chorus_1:
I will [D]sing to you sadness, and then
[Am]   we will feel the joy
[D]   This life is full of madness. Here we 
[C]are, the Hoi polloi [G]
the hoi poll[C]oi 
we are [G]strong  
we’re the hoi poll[C]oi

Verse_2:
[G]   I haven't had a home for too [D9sus4]long
[G]   Being here is better than being [D9sus4]still.  When
[G]   optimism just feels [D9sus4]wrong
[G]   Thinkin' 'bout moving on makes me [D9sus4]ill (ill)

I will [D]sing to you sadness, and then

we’re the hoi poll[C]oi

Verse_3:
[G]   Singing here helps with my dreaming [D9sus4]problem
[G]   Hoping that you all won't [D9sus4]mind
[G]   Maybe my words will help you feel less [D9sus4]lonesome.  Maybe
[G]   that's just me, and you're being [D9sus4]kind (kind)

Chorus_3:
I will [D]sing to you sadness
And then[Am] we will feel the joy
This [D]life is full of madness
Here we [C]are the Hoi polloi[G]
the hoi pol[C]loi we are [G]strong  
we’re the hoi poll[C]oi

Coda:
You’re never al[G]one, with the hoi poll[C]oi
We are com[G]mon, but we’re not ordin[C]ary
The hoi pol[G]loi the hoi pol[C]loi 
The hoi pol[G]loi

Verse_4:
To[G]morrow we’ll go back to happiness pre[D9sus4]tending.  When
[G]   getting out of bed will be just [D9sus4]tough.  Some-
[G]times there’s hope in no happy [D9sus4]endings.  But
[G]I have you {Antifragile} and that's en[D9sus4]ough

Chorus_4:
I will [D]sing to you sadness, and then
[Am]   we will feel the joy

we are [G]strong  
we’re the hoi poll[C]oi

Coda:
You’re never [G]alone, with the hoi poll[C]oi
We are [G]common, but we’re not ordin[C]ary
The hoi pol[G]loi the hoi pol[C]loi 
The hoi pol[G]loi
