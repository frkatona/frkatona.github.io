Verse1:
found us a forest when we walk through the rain
the sun hasn't shined but she brightens my day
loving is pleasing, but nothing comes easy, and
now we're losing our trail
hey hey hey

Verse2:
with a whispering eyes and the shadows of time
what's mine is hers, what's hers is mine
once we're connected, everything's sacred, and
holding us deep down inside
hey hey hey

Instrumental:

Lately we're right here under hypnosis
Where love has the strength to unheed our warnings
Where pleasure is found as we walk through the discourse and
that's been staring our way
hey hey hey

Outro:
