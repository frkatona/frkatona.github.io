Verse1:
They [G]found us a forest when we [D]walk through the rain
the [G]sun hasn't shined but she [D]brightens my day

[A#]now we're losing our [A]trail

Verse2:
with [G]whispering pines and the [D]shadows of time
what's [G]mine is hers, what's [D]hers is mine
[G]once we're connected, [D]everything's sacred, and
[A#]holding us deep down in[A]side

[G]Lately we're right here under [D]hypnosis
[G]Where love has the strength to [D]unheed our warnings
Where [G]pleasure is found as we [D]walk through the discourse and
[A#]that's been staring our [A]way
