Set Time (A major, 120 BPM)

Intro:
[A Bm E7] (instrumental)

Verse1:
[A] Take time by the spotlight and come out [C#m - D] more 
[A] Take my bitter sweet time to look out [C#m - D - C#m - Bm] for
[A] Old times, baby blue eyes that hit like [C#m - D] cannon balls
[A] But it's time to say goodbye, I gotta give the [F#m - F#7] curtain call

Bridge:
[B]Set apart by the screen
[Bm]In the dark, you’re a dream
[A]Every scene, live [C#m] in between
[F#m]the frames, and [E7] all the world’s a

Verse2:
[A] Stage, A makeshift matinee
[E] The greatest show we know
[A] But still you go alone
[E] I never get to say 

PreChorus:
[Bm] When all I want is all used up
[A] And all I have won’t be enough, I
[Bm] dim the lights so you might see
A [F#m] glimpse of what you [E7] mean to me

Chorus:
[A] I don’t know
How every [C#m] flower grows, how every song’s [D] composed, and
[A] I can’t leave
So maybe [C#m] it’s naive to ask that [D] you believe, but [E7] if 
[A/5-3] you    [A/5-2] stay    [A/5-1] here  [C#m] with [D] me
Then maybe I don’t wanna be     [Amaj7/6-0]      free   [C#m] -ee   [Bm] -ee
Be [Amaj7/6-0] free [C#m] -ee   [D6] -ee
Be [Amaj7/6-0] free [C#m] -ee   [Bm] -ee
[F#m] -ee   [F#7] -ee

Bridge:
[Bm]Set apart by the screen
[A]In the dark, you’re a dream
[Bm]Every scene, live [C#m] in between
[A]the frames, and [E7] all the world’s a

Verse3:
[A] Game, A heartfelt masquerade
[E] A losing tug of war
[A] Between my fear and hers
[E] The credits fade away

PreChorus:
[Bm] When all I want is all used up
[A] And all I have won’t be enough, I
[Bm] dim the lights so you might see
A [F#m] glimpse of what you [E7] mean to me

Chorus:
[A] I don’t know
How every [C#m] flower grows, how every song’s [D] composed, and
[A] I can’t leave
So maybe [C#m] it’s naive to ask that [D] you believe, but [E7] if 
[A/5-3] you    [A/5-2] stay    [A/5-1] here  [C#m] with [D] me
Then maybe I don’t wanna be     [Amaj7/6-0]      free   [C#m] -ee   [Bm] -ee
Be [Amaj7/6-0] free [C#m] -ee   [D6] -ee
Be [Amaj7/6-0] free [C#m] -ee   [Bm] -ee
[F#m] -ee   [E7] -ee     [A]
