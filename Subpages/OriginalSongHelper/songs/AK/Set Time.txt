Set Time (A major, 120 BPM, Dream (Spacious Chords))

Intro:
[A Bm A E7] (instrumental)

Verse1:
[A]Take time by the spotlight and come out [C#m - D]more 
[A]Take my bitter sweet time to look out [C#m - D - C#m - Bm]for
[A]Old times, baby blue eyes that hit like [C#m - D]cannon balls
[A]But it's time to say goodbye, I gotta give the [F#m - F#7]curtain call

Bridge:
[Bm]Set apart (by the screen)
[A]In the dark (you’re a dream)
[Bm]Every scene, stuck [C#m]in between
[D]the frames, and [Bm]all the [E7]world’s a

Verse2:
[A]Stage, A makeshift matin[E]ee
The greatest show we kn[A]ow
But still you go a[E]lone
I never get to say 

PreChorus:
[Bm]When all I want is all used up
[A]And all I have won’t be enough, I
[Bm]dim the lights so you might see
A [D]glimpse of what you [E7]mean to me

Chorus:
[A] I don’t know
How every [C#m]flower grows, how every song’s [D]composed, and
[A] I can’t leave
So maybe [C#m]it’s naive to ask that [D] you believe, but [E7] if 
[A/5-3] you    [A/5-2]stay    [A/5-1]here  [C#m]with [D]me
Then maybe I don’t wanna be     [Amaj7/6-0]      free   [C#m] -ee   [Bm] -ee
Be [Amaj7]free [C#m]-ee   [D]-ee
Be [Amaj7]free [C#m]-ee   [Bm]-ee
-ee   [E7]-ee

Bridge:
[Bm]Set apart (by the screen)
[A]In the dark (you’re a dream)
[Bm]Every scene, stuck [C#m]in between
[D]the frames, and [Bm]all the [E7]world’s a

Verse3:
[A]Game, A heartfelt masquer[E]ade
A losing tug of [A]war
Between my fear and [E]her
The credits fade away

PreChorus:
[Bm]When all I want is all used up
[A]And all I have won’t be enough, I
[Bm]dim the lights so you might see
A [Bm6]glimpse of what you [E7]mean to me

Chorus:
[A]I don’t know
How every [C#m]flower grows, how every song’s [D]composed, and
[A]I can’t leave
So maybe[C#m] it’s naive to ask that [D]you believe, but if 
[A/5-3]you    [A/5-2]stay    [A/5-1]here  [C#m]with [D]me
Then maybe I don’t wanna be     [Amaj7]free   [C#m]-ee   [Bm]-ee
Be [Amaj7]free   [C#m]-ee   [D]-ee
Be [Amaj7]free   [C#m]-ee   [Bm]-ee
[Bm]-ee   [E7]-ee     [A]
