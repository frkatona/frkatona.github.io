Let's All Let Go

Chorus:
Stay down, stay warm
Don't drown in storms, just
Say the words
You've left unspoken

hang on, don't fall
let's all let go...together

Find light, hold strong,
Lose night, chase dawn, from
dreams disturbed
return unbroken
 
forgive, absolve
let's all let go (together)

Verse1:
Just sorry for the world, and
The worry worth its weight in gold 
Just sorry that it makes you cry
And carry on without control, from whole to hollow

Just sorry that it drowns you out, and the
weight it places on your soul
I never meant to pull you down,
You always seemed invincible, to face and follow

Bridge1:
Hit the brakes and let it fall away, it's
Hard this way, but let it go
  
you hit the mark, but it's all the same
it fell apart, and I cannot...stay
  
Bridge2:
And honestly, 
it solves this for us, though it
makes me wanna 
cry 

And I believe,
the days are warmest
when they're shortest, at least they're
sure to say goodbye

Chorus:
Stay close, stay safe
Don’t fight the waves, just
Say the truth
You’ve kept inside you

Hang on, don’t fade
Let’s all let go, together

Stay strong, stay true
No wrongs, just you, and the
heart-shaped holes that
never opened

all's said, all's told
lose half, stay whole
Together
