Intro:
Saving the line up for you, yes I’m
Saving the line up for you, Save the line
(line, line)
Saving the line up for you, yes I save that line up for you
Save the line, save the line

Verse1:
I’d say if I want something if you’re
praying that life’s enough then you’ll look 
Down but don’t look back, they’ll keep on
Saying that’s life so tough

If you won’t own up that’s fine
I’ll take that hollow hope you hide
Away from all these altercations
And safe from all this information

PreChorus:
I say, ok, I’ll say, I’ll stay
Ok I’ll stay
Stay away

Chorus:
Hold the line, we're almost there
Through the stormy winter air
In this flight, and in this time
Hold the line, we'll be alright

Verse2:
I’d say if I want something if you’re
praying that life’s enough then save the line
Atop the tallest building
Don’t look down until you’re feeling
Calm enough to keep from screaming
Only far as you are seeming
Come as far as you can face
When hindsight is an aftertaste
And after wasting all your light
When laughter tastes like dynamite
The past is left up to devices
The right to act, to be decisive
Giving might react to heal,
The feel of skin and flint and steel
Hearts away from minds and souls
The hardest place to hide alone

PreChorus:
I say, ok, I’ll say, I’ll stay
Ok I’ll stay
Stay away
I say, ok, I’ll say, I’ll stay
Ok I’ll stay
Stay away

Chorus:
Hold the line, we're almost there
Through the stormy winter air
In this flight, and in this time
Hold the line, we'll be alright
