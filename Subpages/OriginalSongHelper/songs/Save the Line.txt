Hold The Line (Eb, 110 BPM, [tone])

Intro:
Holding the line out for you, yes I’m
Holding that line out for you, hold the [Eb]line
(line, line)
Holding the line out for you, yes I hold that line just for you
Hold the line, hold the line

Verse1:
I’d say that I want something, when I'm
praying that life’s enough, and I look 
down but don’t look back, I'll keep on
saying that’s life, so tough

And if you won’t own up, that’s fine,
I'll take that hollow hope you hide
And fight to hold this line in place
While keeping track of my own face

PreChorus:
I say, ok, I’ll fight, I’ll stay
But every time I turn away
I lose the line that keeps me safe
(?)

Chorus:
Hold the line, we’re almost there
Through the doubts we learn to bear
In this fight, and in this time
Hold the line, or lose what’s mine

Verse2:
I’d say that I want something, when I'm
praying that life’s enough, and holding
strong atop the tallest building, but
Don’t look down until you're feeling

Calm enough to keep from screaming,
holding hands like I was dreaming
Come as far as you can take,
'till hindsight is an aftertaste

And after wasting all your life,
when laughter tastes like dynamite,
the doubt that seeps into the sand
a dying light I'll understand

The calm before the storm can't last, when your
future fights against its past
It's nature's time to turn the the wheel
The feel of skin on flint and steel

Where hearts divide from minds and souls is
the hardest place to hide alone

PreChorus:
I say, ok, I’ll fight, I’ll stay
But every time I turn away
I lose the line that keeps me safe
(?)

Chorus:
Hold the line, we’re almost there
Through the doubts, we learn to bear
In this fight, and in this time,
I'll hold the line, or lose what’s mine

Hold the line, I’m losing ground
Through the cracks, I won’t be found
In this fight, and in this time
I've told myself to hold the line
