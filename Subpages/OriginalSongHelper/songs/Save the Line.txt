[?] I’d say if I want something if you’re
[?] praying that life’s enough then save the line

[?] Calm enough to keep from screaming
[?] Only far as you are seeming
[?] Come as far as you can face
[?] When hindsight is an aftertaste
[?] And after wasting all your light
[?] When laughter tastes like dynamite
