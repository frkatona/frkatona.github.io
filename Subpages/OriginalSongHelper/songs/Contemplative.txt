Contemplative (E, 80 BPM, [tone])

Verse1:
[E riff] Stand tall
 Send to beat town
 Send to beat town in your 
 why - ay- ay- ay

[E] He doesn’t have time to break,
The moment’s crossed, the moment’s [A] gone
[E] There’s always more time to turn the [A] wheel

[E] She hasn’t a clue about the 
Time it took to get [A] away
[E] She’s more of a borrow than a [A] steal

[Pre-chorus]
[E] Don’t get me wrong if we’re talking ‘bout love
[E] Don’t make me laugh about don’t write
[E] Don’t get me wrong we’ve been talking enough
[E] Am I right?

[Chorus]
[E] Don’t be mistaken
[E] If you’re not making your way there
[E] I might awaken in time to catch the 
[E] Wheel

She’s got the blue eyes
But not nothing’s hiding behind them
She cast a spell of swords revealing
Light.  Alright.

You got to be so contemplative
You got to be so contemplative
You got to be the one and all

Be so contemplative
Be so contemplative
Be so contemplative at of all

[Bridge]
Standing at the bottom of beetle’s bottom stand by
Standing at the bottom of be there
