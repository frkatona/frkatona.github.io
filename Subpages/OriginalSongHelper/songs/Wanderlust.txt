[G] This [D]summer, I [F]feel those good vi-

[G] love I [D]just can't [F]get enough
[G] The [D] birds all [F]line the trees
while [G]bees all [D]drink from [F]buttercups
[G] Blue [D]skies and [F]clouds are shaped like 
[G] hearts that [D] seem to [A]open up

Verse2:
The days are long and hard, 
my brain has joined this wanderlust
These golden sunsets are beyond 
what streets that beckon us
Shimmering sidewalks lead 
along a path of playfulness
The shadow's long embrace
The star-swept hearts that call to us

Call to us
Call to us

Chorus:
Let's open up
Let's open up
The summer of love
Let's open up
