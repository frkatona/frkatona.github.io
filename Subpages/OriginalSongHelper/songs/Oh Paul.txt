Oh Paul (Dm, 80 BPM, Dirty (e.g., Basic Chicago))

Verse1:
[Dm]Part of the way where the sun won't go
[Am]Where spirits run and hide
[Dm]Set on the wind that my brother knows
[F]Nature calls and [G7]he [A7]replies

[Dm] Whispers of trails, he'd walked before
[Am] Like dreams of smoke, they fade
[Dm] In the dust where the cold endures,
[F]Chasing [G7]shadows, I'd [A7]say.

Chorus:
[Dm]Oh Paul [Am]-aul
Won't you [F]please stay [Em]home [A7]
[Dm]Oh Paul [Am]-aul
[F]How [G7]could you [A7]know?

Bridge:
(Instrumental)

Verse2:
[Dm]Riding the moon through skies of gray
[Am]Like skipping stones in the night
[Dm]combing the wake for souls astray
[F]Hoping for [G7]one that could [A7]survive

Chorus:
[Dm]Oh Paul [Am]-aul
Won't you [F]please stay [Em]home [A7]
[Dm]Oh Paul [Am]-aul
[F]How [G7]could you [A7]know?

[Dm]Oh Paul [Am]-aul
Won't you [F]please stay [Em]home [A7]
[Dm]Oh Paul [Am]-aul
[F]How [G7]could you [A7]know? [Dm]
