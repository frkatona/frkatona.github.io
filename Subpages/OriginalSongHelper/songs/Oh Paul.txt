Oh Paul (Dm, 80 BPM, Dirty (e.g., Basic Chicago))

Verse1:
[Dm] Part of the way where the sun won't go
[Am] Where spirits run and hide
[Dm] Set on the wind that my brother knows
[F] Nature calls and [G7] he [A7] replies

[Dm] Whispers of trails, he'd walked before
[Am] Like dreams of smoke, they fade
[Dm] In the dust where the cold endures,
[F] Chasing [G7] shadows, I'd [A7] say.

Chorus:
[Dm] Oh Paul [Am] -aul
Won't you [F] please stay [Em] home
[Dm] Oh Paul [Am] -aul
[F] How [E7] could you [A7] know?

Bridge:
(Instrumental)

Verse2:
[Dm] Riding the moon through skies of gray
[Am] Like skipping stones in the night
[Dm] combing the wake for souls astray
[F] Hoping for [G7] one he could [A7] confide

Chorus:
[Dm] Oh Paul [Am] -aul
Won't you [F] please stay [Em] home
[Dm] Oh Paul [Am] -aul
[F] How [E7] could you [A7] know?

[Dm] Oh Paul [Am] -aul
Won't you [F] please stay [Em] home
[Dm] Oh Paul [Am] -aul
[F] How [E7] could you [A7] know? [E7 G7 A7 Dm]
