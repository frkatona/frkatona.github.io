Jolly Cooperation (A, 120 BPM, [tone])

Verse1:
[A] Sometimes you make the morning
[A] Sometimes you’re not as strong
[A] Sometimes a bad moon rises
[A] Sometimes

[A] I’ve come all this way for seeking a sun
[D] Not worthy of one
[Esus] Not in [E7] this state

[A] Fabrics waver while we shift and obscure
[D] Connecting our worlds
[Esus] Twisting our [E7] fates in knots

PreChorus:
[F#m] Don’t worry trying to be another star (wings of wax won’t)
[Bm] You’ll never [C#m] see how far you shine [C#m-F#m-E7](Stay don’t burn out)

Chorus:
[C#m] Sun
[Bm] They say someone
[C#m] Sun
[Bm] They say someone 
[D-C#m-A] (stay don't burn out)

Verse2:
[A] I will stay behind and stare at your sun
[D] It’s come and its gone
[Esus] But not for [E7] nothing

[A] What’s the meaning when you’re born and you die
[D] In the blink of an eye
[Esus] Was the being enough [E7] to say

[F#m] Don’t bother trying to chart another path
[Bm] This force of nature isn’t mine

Chorus:
[C#m] Sun
[Bm] They say someone
[C#m] Sun

Bridge:
[?] ?

[Outro]
[A] Sometimes you make the morning
[D] Sometimes you’re [E7] not as strong
[A] Sometimes you make the morning
[D] Sometimes you’d [E7] come along
[A] Sometimes you make the morning
[D] Sometimes where [E7] you belong
[A]
