Jolly Cooperation (A, 120 BPM, [tone])

Verse1:
[A]Sometimes you make the morning
[A]Sometimes you’re not as strong
[A]Sometimes a bad moon rises
[A]Sometimes

[A]I’ve come all this way for [F#m]seeking a [D]sun
Not [F#m]worthy of [D]one
[Esus]Not in [E7]this state

[A]Fabrics waver while we [F#m]shift and [D]obscure
Con[F#m]necting our [D]worlds
[Esus]Twisting our fates in [Esus4 - E - Esus4]knots

PreChorus:
[F#m]Don’t worry trying to be a[E]nother star (wings of wax won’t)
[G#m]You’ll never[C#m] see how far you [D]shine [Bm-D-E](Stay don’t burn out)

Chorus:
[C#m]Sun
They say [Bm]someone
[C#m]Sun
They say [Bm]someone 
[D-F#m-E](stay don't burn out)

Verse2:
[A]I will stay behind and stare at your sun
[D]It’s come and its gone
But [Esus4]not for [E]no[Esus4]thing

[A]What’s the meaning when you’re born and you die
[D]In the blink of an eye
Was the [Esus4]being e[E]nough to [Esus4]say

PreChorus:
[F#m]Don’t bother trying to chart a[E]nother path
[G#]This force of [C#m]nature isn’t [D]mine [Bm-D-E](Stay don’t burn out)

Chorus:
[C#m]Sun
They say some[Bm]one
[C#m]Sun
They say some[Bm]one

Bridge:
[D] There's no telling how much longer all these gaps between our [Dm]worlds 
[D] Will keep on keeping us from seeking swines and [Dm]pearls
[Emaj7]You're the center of the galaxy, the spiral sea of [Em7]stars
[D]But for us, our lightspeed carriage only sees us from [Dm7]afar
[A]So I can't give up the visions from across the great [C#]expanse
[D]I'm a bearer of the same curse [E6]could that really come from chance?
[A]So if seeing is believing and by morning you'll be [C#]gone 
[E]I'll see you don't turn hollow [E6]as I follow unto dawn

[Outro]
[A]Sometimes you make the morning
[D]Sometimes you’re not as [E7]strong
[A]Sometimes you make the morning
[D]Sometimes you’d come al[E7]ong
[A]Sometimes you make the morning
[D]Sometimes where you be[E7]long
[A]
