Haunt Me to Death
Seana Wood - v24.11 - G - 120 BPM
Instrumental:
[G - Em - C - D]

Verse_1:
You're passing in[G], I’m passing out[Em]
Are we still [C]living, as we float a[D]bout
You’re circum[G]venting, my rounda[Em]bout
I need some rel[C]ief, I just want [D]out

Chorus:
You haunt me [C]deadly
It’s the way I feel in[Em]side
And I [C]notice
In each room you [Em]hide
The universe seems fuller[C]
When you're [D]near
Please haunt me [C]deadly
I miss you [D]here

Verse_2:
Falling [G]plaster, creaking [Em]floors
Soft dusty [C]coatings, popping [D]doors
Still, it feels [G]quiet, between these [Em]walls
Am I still [C]breathing? I don’t feel at [D]all

Chorus:
You haunt me [C]deadly
It’s the way I feel in[Em]side
And I [C]notice
In each room you [Em]hide
The universe seems fuller[C]
When you're [D]near
Please haunt me [C]deadly
I miss you [D]here

Bridge:
[Cmaj7]Am I the shell of the person I used to [G]be?
[Cmaj7]Trying every day to unearth the person that is [G]me [D]
[Cmaj7]With you, tiny moments of authentici[G]ty
[Cmaj7]I remember who I am, and I know the person I want to [G]be  [D]

Chorus:
You haunt me [C]deadly
It’s the way I feel in[Em]side
And I [C]notice
In each room you [Em]hide
The universe seems fuller[C]
When you're [D]near
Please haunt me [C]deadly
I miss you [D]here

Verse_3:
So you ground [G]me, now I can [Em]feel
What it [C]was, was very real[D]
I can't cont[G]rol, what we can [Em]be
I can hope [C], that you can still see [D]me

Chorus:
You haunt me [C]deadly
It’s the way I feel in[Em]side
And I [C]notice
In each room you [Em]hide
{pp}The universe seems [C]fuller
{pp}When you're [D]near
{pp}Please haunt me [C]deadly
{pp}I miss you [D]here

Outro:
I miss you [C]here
I miss you [D]here
I miss you [C]here
