Haunt Me to Death
Seana Wood - v24.11 - G - 110 BPM
Verse_1:
Your passing in[G]
I’m passing out[Em]
Are we still [C]living
As we float a[D]bout
You’re circum[G]venting
My rounda[Em]bout
We/I need some rel[C]ief
We/I just want [D]out

Chorus:
You haunt me [C]deadly
It’s the way I feel in[Em]side
[G]And I [C]notice
In each room you [Em]hide
[G]The universe seems fuller[C]
When you're [D]near
Please haunt me [C]deadly
I miss you [D]here

Verse_2:
Falling [G]plaster
Creaking [Em]floors
Soft dusty [C]coatings
Popping [D]doors
Still, it feels [G]quiet
Between these [Em]walls
Am I still [C]breathing?
I don’t feel at [D]all

Bridge:
[Cmaj7]Am I the shell of the person I used to [G]be?
[Cmaj7]Trying every day to unearth the person that is [G]me [D]
[Cmaj7]With you, tiny moments of authentici[G]ty
[Cmaj7]I remember who I am, and I know the person I want to [G]be  [D]

Chorus:
You haunt me [C]deadly
It’s the way I feel in[Em]side
[G]And I [C]notice
In each room you [Em]hide
[G]The universe seems fuller[C]
When you're [D]near
Please haunt me [C]deadly
I miss you [D]here
