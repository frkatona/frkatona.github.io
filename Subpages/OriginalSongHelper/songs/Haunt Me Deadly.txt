Instrumental:
[G - Em - C - D]

Verse_1:
Your passing in[G]
I’m passing out[Em]
Are we still [C]living
As we float a[D]bout
You’re circum[G]venting
My rounda[Em]bout
I need some rel[C]ief
I just want [D]out

Chorus:
You haunt me [C]deadly
It’s the way I feel in[Em]side
And I [C]notice
In each room you [Em]hide
The universe seems [C]fuller
When you're [D]near
Please haunt me [C]deadly
I miss you [D]here

Verse_2:
Falling [G]plaster
Creaking [Em]floors
Soft dusty [C]coatings
Popping [D]doors
Still, it feels [G]quiet
Between these [Em]walls
Am I still [C]breathing?
I don’t feel at [D]all

Chorus:
You haunt me [C]deadly
It’s the way I feel in[Em]side
And I [C]notice
In each room you [Em]hide
The universe seems [C]fuller
When you're [D]near
Please haunt me [C]deadly
I miss you [D]here

Bridge:
Am I the [Cmaj7]shell of the person I used to [G]be?
[Cmaj7]Trying every day to unearth the [G]person that is [D]me
With [Cmaj7]you, tiny moments of authentici[G]ty
I re[Cmaj7]member who I am, and I know the [G]person [G] I want to [D]be [D]

Chorus:
You haunt me [C]deadly
It’s the way I feel in[Em]side
And I [C]notice
In each room you [Em]hide
The universe seems [C]fuller
When you're [D]near
Please haunt me [C]deadly
I miss you [D]here

Verse_3:
So you ground [G]me
Now I can feel [Em]
What it was [C]
was very real [D]
I can't control [G]
What we can be [Em]
I can only hope [C]
you can still see me [D]

Chorus:
You haunt me [C]deadly

In each room you [Em]hide

Outro:
I miss you [C]here
I miss you [D]here
I miss you [C]here
