Landline
(D, x bpm)


Intro:
| [x]- - - - | (x16)


Verse1:
Landline, high-speed internet
Wi-fi, cable TV
Drift away, 100 miles from the innocent
Gonna feed in a trickling stream

I've been around here, waiting for the second coming
Watching folks that are higher than me
I've seen it all add up, everything around too much
Nothing but locked in this dream


Chorus:
I swear, I'll watch it all go down
Burning down, to the ground
I swear, I'll watch it all go down
Burn it down, into the ground

I asked my guardian angel which way to go
But she don't know, she don't know

| - - - - | (x8)

| [intro reprise]- - - - | (x8)


Verse2:
Heard and static, the bustling streets
I'd rather listen to the crickets in the trees
Feel the wind blowing steady, feel thankful for just a moment
Until you realize we polluted the breeze

| - - - - |

The river's runnin' dry, the ozone is the peak
The asdf is the terrorized deal
asdf
To stop this world from asdf winning


Chorus:
I swear, I'll watch it all go down
Burning down, to the ground
I swear, I'll watch it all go down
Burning down, into the ground

I asked my guardian angel which way to go
But she don't know, she don't know

Outro:
We're going deep, we're going deep (x4)
