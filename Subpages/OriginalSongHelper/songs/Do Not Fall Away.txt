Do Not Fall Away

Intro:
|[?]- - - -| (x4)

Verse1:
And a wave when we were young and have the magic of the day
Down by the lakeside just dreaming our hearts away
As years go by, the mountain pressure takes its pace
And the troubles of the world keep stacking up, getting in your way

If you feel yourself slipping, starting to sway
(instrument line)
Do not fall away
Do not fall away
Do not fall away
