# to-do
 - metronome functionality with more style?
 - song name at top
 - be sure that it's scrollable back up or at least a button to help
 - animation for song list
 
 
 - get global css working for dark mode
 - get metronome working and more intuitive and less obstructive for phone
 - get the font size working
 - make song selection more stylish and intuitive for picking songs during a live set
 - print a QR code link
 - add sections for key and capo and maybe a blurb about the song, Genius-style
 - replace text with icons (scrolling -> down arrow, metronome -> metronome icon)
