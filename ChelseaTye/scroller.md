# to-do
 ## additional functionality and bugs
 - user controls
  - alignment, font size, song helper mode vs lyrics view
  - better scroll speed
 - metronome functionality brainstorming
    - circle flashing stop button?  
    - stopwatch animation with 1,2,3,4 next to the first chord?
 - subtle animation for song list panel
 - make it responsively readable for non-portrait-oriented phones
 - hamburger icon too small on phone

 ## Chelsea:
 - come up with common-sense format for encoding line and chord changes for Chelsea to customizethat I can process into json after
    - maybe like "\section(intro) \chord(Am) test test test \chord(C) test test \line \section(Verse 1) etc."?

 ## Audience/other users:
 - landing page with link to Chelsea's artist IG
 - create/print (engrave?) QR code link
 - maybe a blurb about the song, Genius-style
